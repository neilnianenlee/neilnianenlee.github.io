                            <h3>Reflection on the Projects</h3>
                            <p> Although I had some familiarity with circuit boards from building computers, the projects
                                refreshed my understanding of circuits and the components of a circuit. It provided me with
                                a platform to understand the interaction between hardware and software, and how to
                                troubleshoot issues by figuring out if the issue stemmed from hardware or software.
                            </p>

                                <p>
                                    Built as an extension of starter kit projects 03 and 05, I wanted to use the motor as a
                                    gauge for ambient temperature. 
                                </p>
        
                                <h3>Reflection on the Project</h3>
                                <p>
                                    First, since temperature sensor was digital and semiconductor (I’m not too familiar with the theory), 
                                    reversing the direction of the sensor ended up heating up the sensor 
                                    (and possibly damaging the sensor and burning my thumb and finger). <br>
                                    Secondly, if temperature sensor readings were read quickly (every 15 milliseconds), 
                                    then the temperature sensor jumps from ambient to motor load temperature and 
                                    repeats after the temperature sensors read ambient temperature. 
                                    The solution was to increase the delay of the readings so the motor load would not affect the 
                                    temperature readings.
                                </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Under the guidance of Dr. Igor Tsigelny, I developed the overall program and multiple
                                        subprograms for his database expansion concept. The concept of the database expansion is
                                        to save time required for manual curation of information. The database expansion program
                                        takes about 20 hours for roughly 5,300 entries to be expanded by threefold. This significantly
                                        reduces the amount of time required for information curation as each entry requires manual understanding
                                        of scientific journals and isolating the correct information. This processes usually takes at least
                                        5 minutes, and would take over 1000 hours of manual information curation to expand the database by
                                        the same amount. Overall the program would reduce the amount of time required for the expansion of
                                        the database by 50 times, saving the company extra hours of scientific consultants.
                                    </p>
            
                                    <h3>Reflection on the Project</h3>
                                    <p>20 hours required is for the full expansion of the database. However, if certain subprograms were run in parallel,
                                        then the overall time required to run the expansion could be reduced. This would require more space
                                        than currently required. Further required running time of this program for database expansion 
                                        could be reduced by isolating necessary entries by diffing the stored database and the database to expand.

                                            To familiarize myself with computer hardware once again since the last computer build,
                                            my daily driver was converted from an ATX build to ITX build.

                                            First issue was that RGB LED strips have different wattages. I was unaware and bought 12V
                                            while the motherboard supported 5V. <br>
                                            The 5V RGB LED strips I bought had 4 connectors while the motherboard supported 3. The
                                            motherboard came with a converter which converted 4 connectors to 3.

                                            <h3>Project Details</h3>
                                            <p>
                                                The Build <br><br>
                                                A friend had a computer that constantly bluescreened although memory was thoroughly
                                                tested and found to be working fine. Since I used to troubleshoot my computer issues,
                                                I bought his computer and sought to figure out the issue. <br>
                                                The first step was to build into a POWER MAC G5 case that I got off Craigslist. 
                                                Both computers were gutted. Components were tested and found to be working.
                                                Motherboard standoff locations were planned on cardboard 
                                                and the standoff locations were indicated on the case using permanent marker.
                                                JB Weld was used to permanently mount the motherboard standoffs. Dremel was used to cut
                                                the back of the case for motherboard I/O panel. No I/O shield was installed because 
                                                it would not fit. Case fans were held in place using zip ties. SSDs were held using
                                                velcro, and so was the power supply. Front Panel I/O was soldered, along with 
                                                the jumper wires used to connect some components to the motherboard.

                                                The Troubleshoot <br><br>
                                                System appeared stable for the first day, but gradually became unstable. Blue screens
                                                occurred more and more frequently. RAM was tested for half a day using memTest86, 
                                                and then overnight using the same program. Blue screen errors were not consistent
                                                and rotated between the same 3 errors. OS was repaired and/or reinstalled countless times.
                                                I thought it had been an issue with the storage drives.
                                                After a week of troubleshooting, the CPU gave up the ghost. A replacement CPU was installed
                                                and the system was stable since.

                                            <h3>Reflection on the Project</h3>
                                            <p>
                                                The build was fun and interesting. It was my first time soldering wires and I ended up
                                                soldering roughly 30 wires in total. It was also my first time using a Dremel which was
                                                very exciting and scary, even though protective gear was worn. The troubleshooting was
                                                frustrating as internet resources pointed to bad memory, but it turned out to be the
                                                CPU, which is supposed to be the most reliable component of the computer.
